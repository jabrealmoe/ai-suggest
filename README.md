AI Suggest is a Jira Cloud Forge application designed to intelligently assist users by suggesting improvements to Jira issues. It leverages an external AI agent (via n8n webhooks) to analyze issue data and provide actionable suggestions, such as improved descriptions, summaries, or other enhancements.

## Use Case

When a Jira issue is created or updated, **AI Suggest** automatically triggers an analysis. It presents the user with a list of AI-generated suggestions directly within the Jira issue context panel. Users can review these suggestions and apply them with a single click, streamlining the issue refinement process.

## Key Features

-   **Automated Analysis:** Listens for issue events and sends data to an n8n webhook for AI processing.
-   **Contextual Suggestions:** Displays AI-generated suggestions (e.g., "Refine Description", "Add Acceptance Criteria") in a custom UI panel.
-   **Review Before Applying:** Users can click on a suggestion card to view the full details in a modal before deciding to apply it.
-   **One-Click Application:** select a suggestion to automatically update the Jira issue with the proposed changes.
-   **Visual Polish:**
    -   **Premium UI:** Features a modern, clean interface with glassmorphism effects and smooth transitions.
    -   **Dynamic Loaders:** Includes whimsical, randomized loading animations (Brain/Neural Pulse, Coffee, Magic, Oven, Lightbulb, Plant) to keep users engaged while waiting for AI analysis.
    -   **Interactive Previews:** Detailed view features a slick **typewriter animation** for presenting AI-generated content.
    -   **Match Scoring:** Displays a confidence score for each suggestion to help users gauge relevance.

## How It Works

1.  **Trigger:** A user opens a Jira issue or an event occurs.
2.  **Processing:** The app polls for suggestions generated by the backend AI agent.
3.  **Display:** While loading, a random delightful animation plays. Once ready, suggestions are listed with titles and confidence scores.
4.  **Interaction:** 
    -   Click a card to see the **Detailed View** (full description).
    -   Click "Apply" to instantly update the Jira issue fields.
